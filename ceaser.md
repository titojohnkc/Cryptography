## Ceaser Cipher

One of the simplest and most well-known encryption methods is the Caesar cipher, often known as Caesar's cipher, 
the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift. Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter that is 
located a specific number of positions farther down the alphabet.
